## What is GGJ ?

The GGJ (Global Game Jam) is the world's largest game creation event, taking place simultaneously around the globe. With tens of thousands of participants (jammers) at hundreds of physical and virtual sites in over one hundred countries, it's an incredible opportunity to test your skills and collaborate with others. During the jam, teams race against the clock to create a game that fits a specific theme.

## My First Game Jam!

As a game development beginner who's only been learning for 3 months (honestly, still a novice!), I was excited to jump into my first GGJ. Joining with my game dev club, we formed two teams - one for digital games and one for board games. Naturally, I joined the digital side, working alongside my three teammates. With only 36 hours to create a game, it felt like a crazy challenge, but we were determined to give it our best shot.

This year's theme, "Make me laugh," initially stumped us. Trying to think of a funny game concept, we tossed around ideas for about three hours. Finally, after much deliberation, we landed on a bomb tag game. The idea was simple: run away from the player with the bomb, and if you get tagged, you become the next bomber! We figured it would be a blast to play with friends.

## Development and Challenges
Our first step was brainstorming the core mechanics and implementation strategies. Being a team of developers, we strived for clean, readable code and considered utilizing concepts like OOP, singletons, interfaces, and even SOscript. However, facing knowledge gaps, I spent several hours learning and applying these concepts to the game. Embrace the pain; that's how we grow! The night was fueled by caffeine and coding, with good vibes thanks to free food and drinks. Though sleep tempting, the next morning found us still coding, brimming with energy despite exhaustion.

Implementing new concepts presented hurdles, so I kept things simple to avoid complications. The real challenge arose during code merging. Incompatibilities forced us to spend precious time fixing bugs and unfortunately, sacrifice some cherished features. It was painful, but a necessary compromise to complete the game within the deadline. As the clock ticked down, we finally crossed the finish line, jubilant with our accomplishment.

## The Game
Our game, "Tag Tag Boom" is a 2D multiplayer game where players run around a map, trying to avoid the player with the bomb. If you get tagged, you become the next bomber! The game ends when only one player remains. It's a simple concept, but we had a lot of fun playing it. We hope you do too!

## What I Learned?
This jam marked a major growth spurt for me. I gained valuable insights into game development, particularly the crucial roles of planning and collaboration. It also served as a humbling reminder of how much I still have to learn! I'm deeply grateful for the opportunity to participate and can't wait for the next one. With continued dedication, I'm excited to hone my skills and bring more games to life in the future.

## Conclusion
This wouldn't have been possible without my incredible teammates and my supportive club. I'm so happy to be a part of such a talented and passionate group. Onwards to more jams and more fun!
