## Hi there👋!
**Why I am starting this blog ✍️ ?**

{{< typeit

>}}I'm Dat, a student studying in Vietnam 🇻🇳.
A few months back, I got into web development. In my class, we covered HTML, CSS, Javascript, and a bit of the Jquery framework. That got me interested in creating my own website, so I started learning about Hugo and how to use it. I'm also working on improving my English. I decided to make this blog to share what I've learned and boost my English skills. Hope you find something useful here 🥳.
