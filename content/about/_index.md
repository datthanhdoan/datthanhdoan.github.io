Hi, I'm Đạt (you can call me Dat or Charlie). I'm a student studying at Phenikaa University. Currently, I'm learning about game development. When I delve into the world of game development, it feels like a new adventure for me. I want to learn more and share what I've learned. That's why I've created this blog to share my knowledge and experiences in game development. I hope you will find something useful here.
