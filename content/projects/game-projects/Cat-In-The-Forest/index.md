## How the Game Was Born ❓
I wanted to create a top-down game but didn't have any specific ideas. A friend of mine showed me a game similar to Cowboy, and I thought it would be a good idea to make a game like that. However, I wanted to change it a bit, focusing on a cat and simplifying the gameplay. Thus, "Cat In The Forest" was born.

## Gameplay 🐾
In this game, you are a cat roaming the forest. You can move around, find food, and earn money from quests. Once you accumulate enough money, you can purchase new land (advance to the next level). The game can be played using a mouse 🖱️, but it's also compatible with a gamepad 🎮.
