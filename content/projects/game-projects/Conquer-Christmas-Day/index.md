## Introduction
My game club have an idea to make games for Christmas 2023. Each group will make a game and we will combine them into a game collection. I very excited about this project and after that I have an idea to make a game about about crafting genre.
## Inspiration
A few years ago . I'm a big fan of Minecraft and I have played it for a lot of time ( even it's night and I have to go to school the next day ðŸ˜‚). So I think it will be fun if I take an idea from my favorite game and make it into my own game.
## And now , play the game !
